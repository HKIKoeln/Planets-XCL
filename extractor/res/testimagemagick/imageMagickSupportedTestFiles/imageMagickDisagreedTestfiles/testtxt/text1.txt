Project News 
17-July-2008 From Adam Farquhar, Project Coordinator 
Once again, I must congratulate you on the achievements of the Planets project over the past year. We have now completed the end-of-project-year review, and I can say that both the commission and reviewers were pleased with the advances that we have made. We can expect continued full funding of the project for the next period! 
Special thanks are due to the people who participated in person, gave presentations, and dared to give demonstrations: Adrian Brown, Amir Bernstein, Andrew Jackson, Anne-Louise Joel, Birte Christensen-Dalsgaard, Brian Aitken, Christoph Becker, Dirk von Suchodoletz, Frank Houtman, Hans Hofman, Hans Jansen, Jasper Schroder, Krystyna Ohnesorge, Mandy Yarwood, Manfred Thaller, Max Kaiser, Ross King. And extra-special thanks to Mandy Yarwood for the outstanding and good-hearted support that she has given the project throughout the review process. We are also thankful to Helen Hockx-Yu for the guidance that she gave the project during the year.
