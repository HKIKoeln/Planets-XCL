Planets Internal Newsletters
From Planets Wiki
Internal Project Communication: Planets Monthly Internal Newsletter

Why?

The goal of the internal newsletters is to improve the flow of information in Planets and make it easier for everybody to stay updated on the overall progress of the project. But the goal is also to share successes and milestones as they happen/are reached in individual work packages/Sub-projects. Some might even say that the hidden goal is to tie the WP's closer together as more and more people become involved in the project and the risk of fragmentation gets bigger.


How to use the newsletters

The final version of the chapters should be written by Sub-project leaders (or WP-leaders) by the end of each month - or two or three days into the following month.

However, individual work package participants may add information and events during the month in question. At the end of the month it's the WP leader's job to compile all the information into a more formal report. Please feel free to add events as they happen - and allow yourself to be a little informal, too! The final version of the chapter will have all the formality you can ask for :-)

The newsletters provide progress information of each sub-project to the entire project and they will also be of great help when completing the 3-monthly reports as well.
